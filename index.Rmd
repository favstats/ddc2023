### Studying **usage** of *online political microtargeting* 

+ Ad Libraries

  + some improvement to before

  + inadequate (Edelson et al., 2020; Leerssen et al., 2019)
  
  + In the EU they at least provide targeting based on age, gender, location (thank you DSA)

+ Browser extensions

  + Rely on the "Why am I seeing this ad" label (López Ortega, 2022; Silva et al., 2020)
  
  + do not always correspond to the targeting criteria used by advertisers (Andreou et al., 2018)

+ Interviews

  + in-depth first-hand knowledge
  
  + campaigns might not be willing to share information on how they utilize voter data for targeted ads
  
  
-> current data mostly **I N A D E Q UA T E** for studying the phenomena

## Aims of this Research

**Descriptive Data Analysis of Political Microtargeting**

**Worldwide Context (not just US, UK and Europe)**

---

## Research Questions

+ RQ1: Assessing the Scale

  + **How prevalent** is the use of political microtargeting across the globe **and which targeting and exclusion strategies** do political campaigns employ?

<!-- How much money do political parties spend on targeted ads vs. ads that are targeted towards entire country?  -->

<!-- Split up by country, party type and family/ideology. -->

+ RQ2: Which countries?

  + How do different strategies of targeting and exclusion manifest across **countries**?

+ RQ3: Which parties?

  + How do different strategies of targeting and exclusion manifest across **parties**?

<!-- 1.	who are the most targeted audiences -->
<!-- 2.	who are the most excluded audiences -->
<!-- 3.	how this differs by country/party type and family/ideology -->

## Conclusions

+ Online political **targeting** is **common around the world**

**However:**

  + Most commonly using a single targeting criterion
    
  + Most commonly using location and socio-demographics (e.g. age)

--

**So is political microtargeting overhyped?**

--

+ Its usage in less-democratic countries or less stable societies should make us pause 


+ political microtargeting is used **by both left and right**

  + they **target** their respective **core audiences**
  
      + i.e. concerns about a **defragmented public sphere*** not unfounded
      
  + they often target people already **interested in politics**
  
      + i.e. concerns about **"political redlining"**    not unfounded
      
---

## Conclusions

+ The **Ad Targeting Dataset** released by Meta is a **step in the right direction** for ad transparency

  + **however**, increases **dependency on Meta, should be seen critical**, especially given  announcement of recent Twitter API changes

  + dataset is **not easily accessible** for researchers, and not at all by civil society

## APPENDIX



---

#### RQ1 How big is the phenomena of Political Microtargeting?

    
### First Issue: Meta Ad Targeting Dataset is Messy

*How do we identify political actors advertising on Meta?*

1. Hand-labeled data: Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany

2. Self-identified labels as "political" party/candidate etc.

    - scrape this from the Facebook Ad Library (have done this for 180k+ advertisers)
    
![](img/tags.png)


---

### Netherlands

![](img/NL)

---

### Germany

![](img/DE)

---

### Denmark

![](img/DK)

---


### Second Issue: Which party do advertisers belong to?

1. Matching using party names and abbreviations -> can be messy!
    + this may include also searching for content of ads

2. (Automated) Wikipedia search (especially for candidates)

3. Let ChatGPT do it? ;')



---

## Validation of Automated Matching

1. Make sure we are not missing any influential spenders
    + Retrieve 50 Top Spenders for each election
    + Retrieve 50 Top Spenders who were automatically not matched
    + hand-label them

2. From the rest, draw a random sample of 100 matched and non-matched advertisers
    + hand-label them
    + make sure we also have smaller advertisers cause they count as well
    
20 Elections X 200 Hand-labelling = 4000 coding task
    
    
---

## Questions

Does anyone have ideas about how to

1. maximize coverage (more countries)
2. keep data quality high (other validation methods)

One other idea: classify with machine learning model that is out there? I know Google can identify names and logos from images.. but can it also identify political party from names?

---

## Conclusion

End the paper with a research agenda: what should we research in the future? 



**Thanks for listening!**

## Some Rest


---

<br>

+ February 2021 Meta gives *vetted researchers* access to an "ad targeting dataset"

    + **Actual** targeting criteria used in Social Issue, Electoral, and Political (SIEP) ads on the **ad-level**
    
    + through the FORT platform (**F**acebook **O**pen **R**esearch and **T**ransparency) 
    
    + Timeframe: August 3rd - November 1st , 2020
    
    + Coverage: Only the United States
    
    + Difficult to get access
    
---


### Data on Ad Targeting


+ September 2022: Meta adds "Audience" tab to public Meta Ad Library  

    + Coverage: All countries in which political ads run
    
    + Targeting criteria: Age, Gender, Location, Language, "Interests" and "Behaviour", Custom and Lookalike Audiences 
    
    + Downside: only available for last 7, 30, and 90 days windows
    
    + No possibility to download data (however: I've written an R package to be released to access data)
        
![](img/targeting2.png)

---

### Previous studies suggest advertisers on Meta primarily target own supporters

**Fowler et al. 2021** conclude in their comprehensive study on Meta ad targeting in the 2018 US midterm election


> "all point[s] toward the use of social media ads for **mobilization of existing supporters** as opposed to persuasion of marginal voters"

<!-- based on three factors: -->

<!-- + reduced negativity -->
<!-- + lower issue content -->
<!-- + increased partisanship -->

<!-- compared to TV ads -->

**Ridout et al. 2021:**

> More than 50% of ads are **acquisition, fundraising, and mobilization** ads in selected Senate races on Meta.

**Stuckelberger and Koedam 2022:**

> Our analysis across five countries [...] suggests that **coalition maintenance** is the dominant party strategy for demographic groups.

## Theories for who gets targeted & 
## who gets excluded



---

### Theories for who gets targeted & who gets excluded


#### Coalition Maintenance vs. Expansion strategies 

*Based on Rohrschneider 2002; Panagopoulos and Wielhouwer 2008; Stuckelberger and Koedam 2022*

<br>

+ **Coalition maintenance strategy** (*"mobilizing"*)

    + Reach out to people who are past and present supporters to strengthen coalition 

+  **Coalition expansion strategy** (*"chasing"*)

    + Target people who are potential voters or yet undecided to expand coalition 


---

### Theories for who gets targeted & who gets excluded


#### **Consideration sets** 

*(Based on Oscarsson and Rosema 2019)*

+ Originally a marketing theory on consumer behaviour: 
    + set of products that consumer would be willing to buy based on certain criteria 
        + for example, price, brand, etc.


+ In electoral context: 
    + set of political parties citizen would vote for based on certain criteria 
        + e.g. ideological alignment, chances to govern, be in parliament, etc.
    
<br>
    
+ **In targeting context (from perspective of campaigns):**
    + set of audiences that a party chooses to advertise to 
        + e.g. based on **issue ownership**, past vote, ideological alignment, etc.
    + implies: audiences outside of consideration sets should be excluded

## Hypotheses

> Parties target audiences within consideration set

> Parties exclude audiences outside their consideration set

Maybe:

> Smaller parties are more likely to engage in coalition expansion rather than coalition maintenance in an effort to gain votes from bigger competitors

---


## Requirements

1. Decide which elections should be studied

    + Suggestion: Netherlands 2021, Germany 2021, Canada 2021, Italy 2022, Sweden 2022, Denmark 2023 (?)
    + other elections: Lithuania 2020, Portugal 2020, Liechtenstein 2021, Bulgaria 2021, Cyprus 2021, Norway 2021, Iceland 2021, Czech Republic 2021, Hungary 2022, Slovenia 2022
    
2. Coding of targeting criteria into 
    
    +  **in consideration set**
        + Supporters                 
        + Potential voters       
        
    +  **outside of consideration set**
        + People who are not likely to vote for party
    
> requires some expertise in studied countries

Question: what about targeting criteria that do not fit in any of these categories?

---

## Who targets who and why but.. also how?

+ So this research design does not incorporate at all **which messages** parties use to target people.

+ Is this a major flaw? Reasonable compromise?

### More questions

Does the theory idea make sense?

Any other suggestions?

Problem with the theory: what about political parties that want to **demobilize supporters of the opposing party**? That's not accounted for. However: is this even an issue outside of the US?
